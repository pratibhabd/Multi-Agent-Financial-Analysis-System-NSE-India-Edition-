# Multi-Agent-Financial-Analysis-System-NSE-India-Edition-

Autonomous agentic AI system for NSE stock research using multi-agent workflows.
Built for investment research, with prompt chaining, routing, evaluator–optimizer, and persistent memory across runs.
Example run: RELIANCE.NS.

 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how autonomous agents can perform equity research in the Indian stock market (NSE).
The system fetches prices, processes news, contextualizes macro data, routes tasks to specialist agents, and generates a self-refined research note.

✅ InvestmentResearchAgent – central orchestrator (plans → runs → evaluates → optimizes → learns).
✅ Specialist Agents – Earnings, News, Market.
✅ Workflow Patterns – Prompt Chaining, Routing, Evaluator–Optimizer.
✅ Memory – stores lessons across runs (agent_memory_nse.json).
✅ Colab Notebook – fully runnable with mock data (no API keys required).
